# Learn Japanese

This is under construction.

## Ideas

- Keep track of how many good answers in a row you have for both quizzes
- Flash cards with dictionary, split by topics
- Confetti behind the accurate guess when clicking on the table
- A few syllables in a row, ideally actual words, that you have to build from cards. Must click in order (no drag and drop)
